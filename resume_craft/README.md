‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Node.js & npm/yarn: Install Node.js

MongoDB: Install MongoDB and ensure it's running.

LaTeX Distribution: Install a LaTeX distribution that includes pdflatex (e.g., TeX Live for Linux/Windows, MacTeX for macOS).

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/krisn2/rust-cohort/tree/main/resume_craft
cd resume_craft

2. Backend Setup (Rust)
Navigate to the resume_back directory:

cd resume_back

Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the resume_back directory and add your MongoDB URI and JWT secret key:

DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-for-jwt-signing # IMPORTANT: Change this to a strong, random key in production!

Run the Backend:

cargo run

The backend server will start on http://127.0.0.1:8080.

3. Frontend Setup (React)
Open a new terminal and navigate to the resume-frontend directory:

cd ../resume-frontend

Install Dependencies:

npm install # or yarn install
